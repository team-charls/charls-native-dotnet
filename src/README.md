# CharLS.Native .NET

CharLS.Native .NET is an adapter assembly that provides access to the native CharLS JPEG-LS C++ implementation for .NET based applications.  
JPEG-LS (ISO-14495-1) is a lossless/near-lossless compression standard for continuous-tone images.

## Features

* Support for .NET 7.0, .NET 6.0 and .NET Framework 4.8.
* Support for the .NET platforms: Windows, Linux and macOS.

## How to use

CharLS.Native can be added to your C# project using the dotnet command line or the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

### Install using the dotnet command line

```bash
dotnet add package CharLS.Native
```

### Windows specific installation steps

The NuGet package comes with prebuilt CharLS DLLs for x86, x64 and ARM64 targets.
The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022 (v14.35 or newer) needs to be installed on the target system.

### Linux specific installation steps

A prebuild CharLS shared library can be installed using the Apt package manager:
